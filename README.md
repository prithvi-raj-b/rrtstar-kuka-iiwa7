## Motion Planning codes for the ED5215 course

Pre-requisites:
- PyBullet
- Robotics toolbox [![Powered by the Robotics Toolbox](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petercorke/robotics-toolbox-python/master/.github/svg/rtb_powered.min.svg)](https://github.com/petercorke/robotics-toolbox-python)

Abstract:
In this project, we conducted a comparative study of different motion planning algorithms for surgical tasks. In the second part, we incorporate a remote center of motion (RCM) constraint. We calculate forward kinematics using the DH parameters of the KUKA IIWA arm and utilize an inverse kinematic solver to generate points that satisfy the RCM constraint. These motions are then simulated in a PyBullet environment, and the
performance of the algorithms is evaluated.

A sample RCM motion is shown below,
